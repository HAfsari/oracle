# oracle ACL

In 11g and beyond, Oracle has introduced the ability to restrict connections to specific hosts (or IP addresses). The access control lists (ACL) are used to restrict the hosts that are allowed to connect to the Oracle database. ACL"s are created using the dbms_network_acl_admin and dbms_network_acl_utility packages.
